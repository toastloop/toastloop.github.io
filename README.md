## About

I'm a 34 year old Computer Science student currently attending The University of Texas at El Paso. My concentration is in Secure Cyber Systems. I am the cofounder and current president of the [Free and Open Source Software Club](https://github.com/FOSS-club-UTEP/) at UTEP. I am also a technical lead for [CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) at UTEP, which teaches cyber security skills to underserved high schools in the El Paso area. Before college I spent 12 years in the United States Army where I worked on Radios, Networks, Satellite Communication, Microwave Communication, and Encryption.
